 Q.3 What is a StatelessWidget ?
 
 A stateless widget is a widget that describes part of the user interface by building a constellation of other widgets that describe the user interface more concretely. A StatelessWidget does not require mutable state.They have no internal state and  have no widget redrawing.

  Q.4 What is a StatefulWidget ?
   
 StatefulWidget instances themselves are immutable and store their mutable state either in separate State objects that are created by the createState method, or in objects to which that State subscribes, for example Stream or ChangeNotifier objects, to which references are stored in final fields on the StatefulWidget itself.They have internal state and  have widget redrawing.

 children horizontally, and tries to be as tall as its parent.
